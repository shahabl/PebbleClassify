PebbleClassify
==============

Companion Pebble App to get Acceleration info from the watch and tell what you're doing!

This employs a very simple decision tree to classify the user action from a predetemined set (resting, typing, walking, running).  This project is a simple demo to show how to communicate with Pebble and use the accelerometer data.

To build this project first install PebbleKit for iOS (see the instructions on Pebble Dev site).
If using CocoaPods, execute `pod install` to setup the project first.
